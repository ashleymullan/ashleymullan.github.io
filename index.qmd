# 👋 Hi, and welcome to my website! 

I'm **Ashley**, a Ph.D. student at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/biostatistics-graduate/) and research assistant in the <a href="https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/vanderbilt-department-biostatistics" target="_blank">Department of Biostatistics</a> at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. These days, I work with [Dr. Rameela Raman](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/person/rameela-raman) and her analytics team at the [Vanderbilt Center of Excellence for Children in State Custody](https://www.vumc.org/coe/person/faculty-staff) to enhance the quality of services provided to children in or at-risk of entering the Tennessee child welfare or juvenile justice systems.

I earned my master's degree from the <a href="https://stats.wfu.edu" target="_blank">Department of Statistical Sciences</a> at Wake Forest University, where I worked with [Dr. Sarah Lotspeich](https://www.sarahlotspeich.com/) on methods to handle measurement error and their exciting applications to the study of local food access. Go Deacs! 🎩

Before heading to graduate school, I studied applied mathematics with [Dr. Murong Xu](https://sites.google.com/prod/view/murongxu/home) and philosophy in the [Special Jesuit Liberal Arts](https://catalog.scranton.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=56&poid=8330&hl=%22special+jesuit%22&returnto=search) program at the University of Scranton. Go Royals! 💜

I 💖 working with data and talking about sitcoms and romcoms, sometimes even [at the same time](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRwA-At8TQ853uAKEudn6Ol84eFd4LJp/view?usp=sharing)!
