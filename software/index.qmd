### I'm a Contributor

POSSUM has functions implementing the maximum likelihood estimator for Poisson regression (with a misclassified covariate) that I derived during my master's thesis, while ThemePark has functions implementing a ggplot theme I designed in honor of Taylor Swift's newest album, *The Tortured Poets Department*.
